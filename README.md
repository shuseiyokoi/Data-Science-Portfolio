## CPPI_simulation
Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) is a popular investment strategy used to manage portfolio risk while seeking higher returns. The method allocates funds between risky and risk-free assets based on a defined "cushion," which represents the excess of portfolio value over a predefined floor. This project demonstrates a CPPI strategy simulation using real-world financial data retrieved from Yahoo Finance.
